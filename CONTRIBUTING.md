## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your enthusiasm in contributing to open source, especially to this repository. Your valuable contributions will undoubtedly help users find the best learning resources. We are excited that you are considering contributing to this project, as our efforts will have a positive impact. Welcome aboard!

### Check the Issues First
Before you make your changes, please consider checking the issues first. Your changes might have been disallowed or rejected already. Although this part might look optional, it'll avoid duplications in the pull requests' approvement process.

Since almost all contributors are about making changes to a single `README.md` file, if you've already forked this archive while ago, please update your forked repository with the `origin` remote repository first.

### Qualified References
We have collected this archive to be a perfectly neat starting point for those who need to start a career or even learn a new technology in any Python-related fields. Before you add your choices, make sure your reference is qualified based on the following criteria.

- The mentioned reference (Book, Video, Documentation, etc) **MUST** approve its creator's license in case of sharing and distribution.
- Positive-reviewed references have higher chance of accepting by the maintainers.
- The reference should explain the related subject in detail.

### Request for a New Section
You have a new topic that is not listed in the repository? Open a new issue and explain more about it.

### Keep Your PR Updated

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
